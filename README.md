**Question 1**

XR can provide users with a more immersive experience, allowing them to feel as if they are actually there, rather than just experiencing it through a screen. In VR, turning your head or crouching will naturally change your perspective, just like in real life. Ordinary games cannot achieve this.

**Question 2**

Interaction is primarily achieved through two Oculus Touch controllers. Users can use the trigger button to grab objects, the grip button to hold or interact with objects, and the joystick to move their character and rotate their view.

**Question 3**

I think the coolest thing about XR applications is their interaction mode, which differs from traditional applications. Although the ones I have experienced so far still require controllers to operate, the interaction mode is really interesting.

**Question 4**

The design of the game world should be as close to reality as possible, allowing players to feel as if they are truly “in” that world. Game scenes are typically designed to be relatively open, making it easy for players to move around, turn, and reach for objects. The controls are also more natural, such as using a controller to grab, press, or hit, or using gestures to select menus or swipe through interfaces.
